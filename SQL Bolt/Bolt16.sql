# SQL Lesson 17: Altering tables
# As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your 
# corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, 
# remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

# Adding columns
# The syntax for adding a new column is similar to the syntax when creating new rows 
# in the CREATE TABLE statement. You need to specify the data type of the column along 
# with any potential table constraints and default values to be applied to both existing 
# and new rows. In some databases like MySQL, you can even specify where to insert the 
# new column using the FIRST or AFTER clauses, though this is not a standard feature.

# Altering table to add new column(s)
# ALTER TABLE mytable
# ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint 
#     DEFAULT default_value;
# Removing columns
# Dropping columns is as easy as specifying the column to drop, however, 
# some databases (including SQLite) don't support this feature. 
# Instead you may have to create a new table and migrate the data over.

# Altering table to remove column(s)
# ALTER TABLE mytable
# DROP column_to_be_deleted;
# Renaming the table
# If you need to rename the table itself, 
# you can also do that using the RENAME TO clause of the statement.

# Altering table name
# ALTER TABLE mytable
# RENAME TO new_table_name;
# Other changes
# Each database implementation supports different methods of altering their tables, 
# so it's always best to consult your database docs before proceeding: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server.

# Exercise
# Our exercises use an implementation that only support adding new columns, 
# so give that a try below.

use bolt;

select * from movies;

# Exercise 17 â€” Tasks
# Add a column named Aspect_ratio with a FLOAT data type to store the 
# aspect-ratio each movie was released in.
alter table movies add Aspect_ratio float;

# Add another column named Language with a TEXT data type to store the 
# language that the movie was released in. Ensure that the default for this language is English.
alter table movies add column language varchar(50); # default 'English';
update movies set language = 'English' where language is null;
